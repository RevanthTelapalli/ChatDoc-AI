# ChatDoc-AI
In today's data-driven world, extracting insights from documents and charts is essentialâ€”but often time-consuming. The ChatDoc-AI Chatbot simplifies this process by providing an AI-powered interface that lets users interact with files using natural language.
This project combines Streamlit, Gemini AI, and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to deliver fast, accurate document analysis. Users can upload CSV files and image-based data (charts, graphs, scanned documents), then query the extracted content effortlessly
